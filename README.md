## This is my weather forcast project
It can display the weather data of the selected city if it exist in the API's store. 
By default it shows Budapest's weather but you can add/delete differrent card/cities.
You can switch between today and next two days' weather forecast.
Aim: use fetch and axios, switch the display between today and forecast views, add and delete cards

## About the API and how it works

WeatherAPI.com provides access to weather and geo data via a JSON/XML restful API. It allows developers to create desktop, web and mobile applications using this data very easily.

Register here: https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx --> and get an API key.
With a free account, you have permission for realtime weather, 3 day forecast, hourly weather, sports API, astronomy API, time zone API, search API and last 7 days history. 

In this project I used the 

Realtime API 
Current weather or realtime weather API method allows a user to get up to date current weather information in json and xml. The data is returned as a Current Object.

and 

Forecast API
Forecast weather API method returns upto next 10 day weather forecast and weather alert as json. The data is returned as a Forecast Object.
